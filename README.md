# Project "Random Mixed Charm"

This project is a web application that provides users with a delightful experience of exploring a diverse collection of beads. Users can browse and interact with various beads, including removing items, switching between collections, and more.

## Functionality

• Random Bead Display: The main page of the application displays random 
  beads from a collection. Each bead is accompanied by a description, 
  price, and an image.

• Item Removal: Users can remove items from their collection by 
  clicking the "Remove" button next to the bead. The removed item is 
  instantly taken out of the list.

• Delete All: For convenience, there is a "Delete All" button at the 
  bottom of the page, allowing users to clear the entire collection 
  with one click.

• New Collection: A slider labeled "New Product" enables users to 
  navigate through a new collection of beads. The slider displays 
  images, descriptions, and prices of beads from the new collection.

• Navigation Controls: Users can navigate through the new collection 
  using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons on the slider.

• Data Customization: Data for the beads is sourced from two initial 
  files, data.js and dataTwo.js. You can easily edit or add new items 
  to these files to update the products displayed in the application.
